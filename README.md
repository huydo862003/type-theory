Hands-on implementations of type systems, interpreters, and related concepts. Includes exercises from TAPL, PLAI, Software Foundations, and other sources.

**Progress tracker**: [scrambled kitchen](https://huydo862003.github.io/journeys/plt)

**Companion projects**:
  - [dboxide](https://github.com/hdnax): A rewrite of DBML in Rust, learning from `rust-analyzer`.

I would be glad if anyone helps me point out the error that I made or enlighten me on some aspects.

## Setup

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for reproducible development environments.
